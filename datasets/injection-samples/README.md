# Prompt Injection Sample Dataset

Goal: collect **sanitized** prompt-injection examples (patterns only). This is for detection research, not exploitation.

Rules:
- `sanitized` must be true.
- Remove payloads, URLs, commands, or anything that could be executed.
- Focus on *patterns* and *intent*.

Contribute samples under `datasets/injection-samples/` (one JSON per sample).
